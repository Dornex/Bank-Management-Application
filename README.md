# Bank-Management-Application

This is one of my University projects. 

It simulates an ATM and its database. The database is done using linked lists. Each card in the database has a history of operations, pin, balance, cvv and a lot of other informations.

There are a lot of administrator or user functions like:

  1. add-card: Adds a card in the database

  2. insert-card: Simulates a human inserting the card in ATM

  3. recharge: Adds money to the last inserted card

  4. cash_withdrawal: Withdraws money from the last inserted card

  5. balance_inquiry: Queries the balance of the last inserted card

  6. pin_change: Changes the PIN

  7. transfer_funds: Transfers money from the last inserted card to another gven card number

  8. show_card: Shows all the info of the current inserted card, including the history of operations

  9. delete_card: Delete a card from the database

  10. cancel: Removes the card from the ATM

  11. unblock_card: Unblocks the card in case the PIN was wrong 3 times in a row

  12. reverse_transaction: Reverses a transaction and updates the history
